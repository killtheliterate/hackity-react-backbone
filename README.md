# Hackity some React and Backbone

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/killtheliterate/hackity-react-backbone.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

A Prototype that demonstrates some ideas for replacing Backbone.Views with React
components.

## Benefits:
* Opportunity to strictly enforce separation of concerns.
* View re-renders are implicit. They occur whenever a Backbone object changes.
* View re-renders are *fast*. They are done by diffing, so only parts that need 
  changing are changed.
* React components are composable.
* JSX is badass.

## Development:

```
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
$ npm install
$ gulp --fatal=off
```
